# 3D Printer Config Customization
Cellection of customizations I've needed to make to 3D printing configs

### Conventions
    - mods.cfg
        - These files contain modifications I've made to pre-packaged macros that come with your printer.cfg
    - macros.cfg
        - These files contain custom macros that did not belong to the printer's original printer.cfg
